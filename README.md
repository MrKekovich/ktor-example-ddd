# Domain Driven Design Example With Ktor

## Overview

This repository contains examples of Domain Driven Design (DDD) implemented with Ktor, a framework for building asynchronous web applications with Kotlin. The main branch is a placeholder, while each specific branch showcases a different project structure and DDD implementation.

## Getting Started

To explore the different DDD examples, you can directly browse the repository on GitHub. Here are the steps:

1. Click on the branch you want to explore, such as `flat` or `layered`.
2. Browse the files and directories of the selected branch to see the DDD implementation with Ktor.

## Projects

The following branches represent different project structures:

- `flat`: A simple project structure with minimal separation of concerns. It's straightforward but lacks a clear division between domain and implementation.
- `layered`: A more structured project with distinct layers separating application logic, domain, and infrastructure, providing better modularity and maintainability.

Feel free to explore each branch to see the different DDD implementations with Ktor.
